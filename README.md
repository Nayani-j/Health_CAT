# Health Cat Chatbot & Geofencing Application

## Overview
This repository contains two main applications designed to enhance healthcare management and patient tracking:

1. **Health Cat Chatbot** üê±üéÄüéª
   - A conversational chatbot powered by Google Gemini AI.
   - Helps in understanding potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) by analyzing medication data and providing detailed insights.
   - Users can upload medical data, extract drug codes, and receive information about drug interactions, side effects, and more.
   - Supports optical character recognition (OCR) to extract information from image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG).

2. **Geofencing Applications**
   - **Main App**: Implements location-based reminders using geofencing technology to track patients or alert for medical emergencies.
   - **Side App**: Provides location-based patient tracking and trip management, specifically designed for emergency situations (e.g., ambulances, patient transfers).

## Features

### Health Cat Chatbot üê±üéÄüéª
- **Drug Interaction Detection**:
  - Upload CSV files containing drug interaction data.
  - Leverage the Gemini AI model to provide detailed insights into the aftereffects of taking two drugs together.
  - Utilize the chatbot to answer healthcare-related queries interactively.
  
- **OCR Integration**:
  - Upload image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) containing prescription details or medical information.
  - The chatbot extracts and processes text using Tesseract OCR, providing users with key medical information like medication lists and summaries.
  
- **LSTM Model for Drug Interaction Level Classification**:
  - Preprocess drug names and interaction data.
  - Use an LSTM neural network to predict the interaction level between drugs.
  - Save and load the model, tokenizer, and label encoder for future use.

### Geofencing Applications
- **Location-based Reminders**:
  - Set reminders based on patient location for administering medications or performing routine checkups.
  
- **Emergency Situations**:
  - Track the patient's location and manage trips, particularly in emergency situations such as ambulance trips or patient transfers between facilities.
  
- **Patient Monitoring**:
  - The side app provides real-time tracking and notifications based on geofencing, ensuring healthcare staff is alerted during crucial moments.

## How to Use

### Health Cat Chatbot
1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Install Python libraries: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `pytesseract`, `tensorflow`, `google-generativeai`, and others listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - Ensure `pytesseract` is installed and configured properly for OCR functionality.

2. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   - To start the chatbot, run the following command:
     ```bash
     streamlit run main_app.py
     ```
   - The app will load the interaction data and drug code information from the specified CSV files. You can then input drug names to check for interactions and view detailed analysis from the Gemini AI model.

3. **OCR Functionality**:
   - Upload images containing medical information to extract text and analyze medications listed in the document.

4. **LSTM Drug Interaction Model**:
   - Train the LSTM model using your data, and classify the interaction level between drugs.

### Geofencing Applications
1. **Main App for Geofencing Reminders**:
   - Set location-based reminders for administering medication or other healthcare tasks.

2. **Side App for Patient Tracking**:
   - Monitor patient location and receive alerts in emergency situations, providing real-time insights during critical moments like ambulance trips.
